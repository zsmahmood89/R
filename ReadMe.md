# R

### Functions

I keep my pet functions here. They're stuff I use in R, such as generating posterior predictions from MCMC output or functions to help me remember JAGS syntax. Really, I don't recommend downloading and using them since these kinds of functions are best written by the end-user themselves (so you can troubleshoot as you see fit). If you do use them and there's a problem, let me know.
